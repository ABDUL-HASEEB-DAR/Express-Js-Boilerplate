# Express.js and Node.js Template with Static Files

This repository serves as a basic template for setting up an Express.js application with Node.js, including handling static files. It's a great starting point for web projects that require a server-side backend. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.


## Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Starting the Server
To start the server using Node.js:

```bash
node index.js
```

Or, if you have nodemon (it automatically restarts the server when changes are made):

```bash
nodemon index.js
```
